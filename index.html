Like all of us, I drew as a child — and I simply never stopped.<br/><br/>Towards the end of my school years, I bought my first sketchbook, and when I started university (studying mathematics at TU Braunschweig in the 1990s), I began working with oil paints. Later, these were replaced by acrylics. Some time ago, I found my way back to oil paints after realising that they also come in a water-soluble form.<br/><br/>Whenever I paint or draw, I need something in front of me: a street, a landscape, a building, a human face, an object — either directly in front of me or in the form of a photograph. I almost never work purely from imagination, and even more rarely in an abstract way.<br/><br/>Sketching while travelling is something special. You walk through a street as a tourist, stop somewhere, sit down, take out your sketchbook. And suddenly I am no longer part of the tourist flow. I am in my own small bubble, the volume drops noticeably, I become an observer, stepping outside for a while. When the sketch is finished, the bubble bursts, the sound returns, and I am a tourist again — one of many.<br/><br/>I don&#x27;t really care whether what I do is “art.” I need creative expression for myself. From time to time my pictures contain a deliberately placed statement, but it is usually visible only to me.<br/><br/>Recently, I have become more and more engaged with portrait work. And so, from time to time, I sit at Kohlmarkt in Braunschweig and offer passers-by a free portrait — free of charge, because I am still practising. (A stage I never want to leave.)<br/><br/></p></div></div><div class="layout_footer">Text unten</div></body></html>
