Mind you — I am not <span class="articles_page_italic">colourblind</span>! I am <span class="articles_page_italic">slightly red-green colour deficient</span>. It&#x27;s not the same thing!<br/>Therefore, the headline should read:</p><h1>What it means to be Slightly Red-Green Colour Deficient</h1><p>First of all it means your kids make fun of you every now and then:<br/></p><br/><div class="articles_page_text_with_image left"><div class="articles_page_text_with_image_block"><a href="/picture/d81dac58-b115-426e-9109-5d8ed37c1f09"><img src="/20220509_182943.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Grogu (green)</figcaption></div><p>“... like the green one.”<br/>“Which green one do you mean?”<br/>“Yoda.”<br/>“Yoda is GREEN?!?”<br/>“Well, yes, Papa, Yoda is green. Didn’t know you?”<br/>“No ...”<br/>“For your whole life? Until today?”<br/>“Seems so...”<br/>“It&#x27;s the same with Grogu, by the way.”<br/><br/>Or you have conversations like this one:<br/><br/>“You made a mistake here, Papa.”<br/>“What?! I never ever make mistakes with LEGO bricks.”<br/>“You used a green brick. It should have been a brown one.”<br/>“Is that so? Well, sure! I get it. You mean this one!”<br/>“Actually, <span class="articles_page_italic">that</span> one is grey.”<br/><br/></p></div><br/><div class="articles_page_text"><p>My children don’t have this deficiency. Even when they were just three years old, they could see things I have never seen. That always fascinated me. If I understand the XY/XX genetics correctly, half of my daughter&#x27;s male kids might inherit it one day. I keep telling her she should have at least ten boys to improve the odds, but she says she&#x27;d have other plans.<br/><br/>It means people sometimes give you a slightly strange look. A while ago there were sheepskin pillowcases in a shop; some dyed (red, blue), some left natural. I picked a bright one and asked the shopkeeper, “This one is undyed, right?”<br/>She looked at me and said, “Well… It&#x27;s pink...”<br/><br/>It means it can take half a century to notice that the roofs of your home town&#x27;s medieval churches, the Statue of Liberty, and other copper things are green.<br/><br/></p></div><div class="articles_page_text_with_image right"><div class="articles_page_text_with_image_block"><a href="/picture/e8f9aa52-f132-443e-9d12-073ac3031689"><img src="/20201121_191014_2.JPG"/></a><figcaption>Lüneburg, 2020</figcaption></div><p>It also means you always feel a little uncertain when it comes to painting. You love blue and yellow, because they appear to everyone else exactly as they do to you. But you have to be careful you don&#x27;t place ochre and may green too close together on the canvas — to you, they can look almost the same. And sometimes you need to ask the people around you for help.<br/><br/>It means you will never truly understand what you are missing, because you have never known anything else. After all, the world looks as colourful as it should. You only notice that people sometimes react differently from what you expect. And every now and then they smile when there is no reason for smiling.<br/><br/>And sometimes, you simply stop caring. You don’t bother. You just use whatever colour feels right and paint like <a href="/tag/genre/wrong_colour/">this</a>.<br/></p></div><br/><p><br/><br/></p><div class="articles_page_favicon"><img src="/favicon.png"/></div></div></div></div><div class="layout_footer"><a href="/privacy">Privacy</a> | © 2026 | All rights reserved</div></body></html>
