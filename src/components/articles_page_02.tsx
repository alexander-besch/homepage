                    Hey! Mind you — I am not <span className="articles_page_italic">colourblind</span>!
                    I am <span className="articles_page_italic">slightly red-green colour deficient</span>.
                    It's not the same thing!<br />
                    Therefore, the headline should read:
                </p >
                <h1>What it means to be Slightly Red-Green Colour Deficient</h1>


                <p>
                    First of all, it means your kids make fun of you every now and then:<br />

                        “Yoda is GREEN?!?”<br />
                        “Well, yes, Papa, Yoda is green. Didn’t you know?”<br />
                        “No ...”<br />
                        “For your whole life? Until today?”<br />
                        “Seems so...”<br />

                        Or you have conversations like this one:<br />

                        “You made a mistake here, Papa.”<br />
                        “What?! I never ever make mistakes with LEGO bricks.”<br />
                        “You used a green brick. It should have been a brown one.”<br />
                        “Is that so? Well, sure! I get it. You mean this one!”<br />
                        “Actually, <span className="articles_page_italic">that</span> one is grey.”<br />

                        My children don’t have this deficiency.
                        Even when they were just three years old, they could see things I
                        have never seen.
                        That always fascinated me. If I understand the XY/XX genetics
                        correctly,
                        half of my daughter's male kids might inherit it one day.
                        I keep telling her she should have at least ten boys to improve the odds,
                        but she says she'd have other plans.<br />
                        <br />
                        It means people sometimes give you a slightly strange look.
                        A while ago there were sheepskin pillowcases in a shop; some dyed (red, blue),
                        some left natural. I picked a bright one and asked the shopkeeper,
                        “This one is undyed, right?”<br />
                        She looked at me and said, “Well… It's pink...”<br />
                        <br />
                        It means it can take half a century to notice that the roofs of
                        your home town's medieval churches, the Statue of Liberty, and
                        other copper things are green.<br />
                        <br />
                    </p>
                </div>

                        It also means you always feel a little uncertain when it comes to painting.
                        You love blue and yellow, because they appear to everyone else exactly as
                        they do to you. But you have to be careful you don't place ochre and
                        may green
                        too close together on the canvas — to you, they can
                        look almost the same. And sometimes you need to ask the people around
                        you for help.<br />
                        <br />
                        It means you will never truly understand what you are missing,
                        because you have never known anything else.
                        After all, the world looks as colourful as it should.
                        You only notice that people sometimes react differently from
                        what you expect. And every now and then they smile when there is no
                        reason for smiling.<br />
                        <br />
                        And sometimes, you simply stop caring.
                        You don’t bother. You just use whatever colour feels right and paint
                        like <a href="/tag/genre/wrong_colour/">this</a>.
