                    Hey! Mind you — I am not <span className="articles_page_italic">colourblind</span>!
                    I am <span className="articles_page_italic">slightly red-green colour deficient</span>.
                    That is not the same thing.<br />
                    Therefore, the headline should read:
                </p >
                <h1>What It Means to Be Slightly Red-Green Colour Deficient</h1>

                    First of all it means your kids make fun of you every now and then:<br />

                        “Yoda is GREEN?!?”<br />
                        “Well, yes, Papa, Yoda is green. You didn’t know?”<br />
                        “No ...”<br />
                        “For your whole life? Until today?”<br />

                        Or you have conversations like this one:<br />

                        “You made a mistake here, Papa.”<br />
                        “What?! I never ever make mistakes when building with LEGO bricks.”<br />
                        “You used a green brick. It should have been a brown one.”<br />
                        “Does it? Well, sure! I know what you mean. You mean this one!”<br />
                        “Actually, <span className="articles_page_italic">that</span> one is grey.”<br />

                        My children don’t have this deficiency.
                        Even when they were just three years old, they could see things I
                        have never seen.
                        That was always fascinating to me. If I understand the XY/XX genetics
                        correctly,
                        half of the male kids of my daughter might inherit it one day.
                        I keep telling her she should have at least ten boys to improve the statistics,
                        but she says she has other plans.<br />
                        <br />
                        It means people sometimes give you a slightly strange look.
                        In a shop, there were sheep fur pillowcases: some coloured (red, blue),
                        some natural. I picked a bright one and asked the shop assistant,
                        “Is this natural?”<br />
                        She looked at me and said, “Well… I think it is pink.”<br />
                        <br />
                        It means it can take half a century to notice that the roofs of
                        medieval churches of your home town, the Statue of Liberty, and
                        other things made of copper are green.<br />
                        <br />
                    </p>
                </div>

                        It means you always feel a little uncertain when it comes to painting.
                        You love blue and yellow, because everything behaves exactly as
                        expected there. But you have to be careful that ochre and may green
                        are not placed too close together on the canvas — to you, they can
                        look almost the same. And sometimes you need to ask the people around
                        you, to help you.<br />
                        <br />
                        It means you will never truly understand what you are missing,
                        because you have never known anything else.
                        The world looks as colourful as it should.
                        You only notice that people sometimes react differently from
                        what you expect. And that they smile when there is no reason for smiling.<br />
                        <br />
                        And sometimes, you simply stop caring.
                        You don’t bother. You just use whatever colour feels right and paint
                        like <a href="/tag/genre/wrong_colour/">this</a>.
