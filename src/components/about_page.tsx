            <h1>About</h1>

            <p>
                When people ask me how long I have been painting or drawing, my answer is: always.
                Like all of us, I drew as a child — and I simply never stopped.<br />
                <br />
                Towards the end of my school years, I bought my first sketchbook,
                and when I started university (studying mathematics at TU Braunschweig in the 1990s),
                I began working with oil paints. Later, these were replaced by acrylics.
                Some time ago,
                I found my way back to oil paints after realising that they also come in a water-soluble form.<br />
                <br />
                Whenever I paint or draw, I need something in front of me:
                a street, a landscape, a building, a human face, an object —
                either directly in front of me or in the form of a photograph.
                I almost never work purely from imagination, and even more rarely in an abstract way.<br />
                <br />
                Sketching while travelling is something special.
                You walk through a street as a tourist, stop somewhere, sit down, take out your sketchbook.
                And suddenly I am no longer part of the tourist flow.
                I am in my own small bubble, the volume drops noticeably,
                I become an observer, stepping outside for a while.
                When the sketch is finished, the bubble bursts, the sound returns, and I am a tourist again — one of many.<br />
                <br />
                I don't really care whether what I do is “art.” I need creative expression for myself.
                From time to time my pictures contain a deliberately placed statement, but it is usually visible only to me.<br />
                <br />
                Recently, I have become more and more engaged with portrait work.
                And so, from time to time, I sit at Kohlmarkt in Braunschweig and offer passers-by a free portrait —
                free of charge, because I am still practising. (A stage I never want to leave.)<br />
                <br />
